As a postdoctoral researcher at the Polar Research Institute of China, I investigate the Arctic's response to climate change, focusing on the sea-ice-atmosphere system and its interaction with Arctic rivers. My research involves the applications of remote sensing, thermodynamic modeling, and machine learning to analyze these complex and interconnected polar processes.
